## What are XRPL Hooks?
XRPL Hooks are small, efficient pieces of code (written in C) that can be attached to an XRP Ledger account to customize its behavior. They allow developers to create programmable functionality on the XRP Ledger without requiring changes to the core protocol.


## Key Components

- **contracts**: Where you write your Hook code in C
- **test**: Contains test files to verify your Hook's functionality
- **Configuration files**: Various setup files for the development environment

## How to Use This Template

This repository serves as a starting point for XRPL Hook development. Developers can:

1. Clone or use this template
2. Write their Hook code in the contracts directory
3. Test their implementation using the provided testing framework
4. Deploy the Hook to the XRPL


This template simplifies the development process by providing the necessary structure and tools for building, testing, and deploying XRPL Hooks.
